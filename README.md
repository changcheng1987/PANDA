# PANDA

## What is it?
PANDA is a novel and comprehensive software package for quantitative proteomics data analysis which is developed based on our solid foundations in quantitative proteomics for years. The advantage algorithms of our previous works, i.e. LFQuant ([Proteomics 2012, 12, (23-24), 3475-84](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23081734)) and SILVER ([Bioinformatics 2014, 30, (4), 586-7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24344194)) have been implemented into PANDA. The core of PANDA was written in standard C++ language on the platform of Microsoft Visual Studio ultimate 2017 in Windows System. And the interfaces of PANDA was implemented in C# on the same platform.

#PANDA & PANDA-view

##What are they?
PANDA is a novel and comprehensive software package for quantitative proteomics data analysis which is developed based on our solid foundations in quantitative proteomics for years. Additionally, PANDA provides user-friendly interfaces for parameter setting, quantification analysis and data visualization (PANDA-view). The core of PANDA was written in standard C++ language on the platform of Microsoft Visual Studio ultimate 2013 in Windows System. And the interfaces of PANDA was implemented in C# on the same platform.
